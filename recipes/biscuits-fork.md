## Ingredients
- 100g (4oz) butter, softened
- 50g (2oz) caster sugar
- 150g (5oz) self-raising flour

## Method
Preheat the oven to 180°C /fan 160°C/ gas 4. Lightly butter two baking trays.

Measure the butter into a bowl and beat to soften. Gradually beat in the sugar and then the flour. Bring the mixture together with your hands to form a dough. Form the dough into 16 balls about the size of a walnut and place spaced well apart on the prepared baking trays. Dip a fork in a little water and use this to flatten the biscuits.

Bake in the preheated oven for 15–20 minutes until a very pale golden. Lift off the baking tray and leave to cool completely on a wire rack.
