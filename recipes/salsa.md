Serve with fajitas or as a topping on burgers

## Ingredients
- 1/2 red onion
- 3 big vine tomatoes
- 1 red chilli
- Juice of 1/2 lime
- Handful of fresh coriander
- Pinch of salt

## Method
Very finely chop onions, chilli, coriander and tomato and mix together.
Squeeze over lime juice. 
Add salt and mix.
Leave in fridge for at least an hour.

### Improvements
Don't include all chilli seeds - only half - unless you want it really spicy.
